# Introduction to SQL
This section provides introductory SQL queries and explanations for beginners, covering the basics of SQL syntax, data manipulation, and retrieval.

# Basic Operations
Learn essential SQL operations such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements. These queries will help you understand how to retrieve, insert, update, and delete data from tables.

# Joins and Set Operators
Master the art of combining data from multiple tables using different types of JOIN operations like INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN. Additionally, explore the usage of set operators such as UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT.

# Subqueries
In this section, discover the power of subqueries by nesting one query inside another. Learn how to write subqueries for filtering, aggregation, and correlation.

# Aggregate Functions
Understand how to perform calculations on sets of rows using aggregate functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX. These queries will help you summarize data and derive meaningful insights.

# Working with Date and String
Learn how to work with date and string data types, perform date calculations, and manipulate string values using SQL queries.

# Group By and Having Clause
Explore grouping data based on one or more columns using the GROUP BY clause. Additionally, learn how to filter grouped data using the HAVING clause.

# Filtering Data
Discover advanced techniques for filtering data using conditions, logical operators, and comparison operators.

# Retrieving Data
Dive deeper into retrieving data from tables using various SELECT statement options, including sorting results, limiting rows, and handling NULL values.

# DDL Operations
Understand Data Definition Language (DDL) operations like creating tables, modifying table structures, and defining constraints.

# DML Operations
Learn Data Manipulation Language (DML) operations such as inserting, updating, and deleting data from tables.

# DML Statements with Subqueries
Combine DML statements with subqueries to perform complex data manipulations and updates based on specificconditions.

# Analytic Functions
Explore advanced SQL features like analytic functions, which allow you to perform calculations across a set of rows while returning results alongside the original data.
